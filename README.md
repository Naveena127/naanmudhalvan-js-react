# React-ToDoList-App

A React Todo List App is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Built using React, it provides an intuitive interface where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Here’s a basic outline of its features and functionality.


## Features

- Add New Tasks: Users can input a new task and add it to their to-do list.
- Mark as Complete: Users can mark a task as completed, typically with a strikethrough style or moving it to a "completed tasks" section.
- Edit Tasks: Users can update the task content if they need to make changes.
- Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list once they are no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering reusable components and dynamic rendering.
- Frontend: React for dynamic UI updates.
- Styling: CSS or styled-components for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- State Management: React’s useState or useReducer hooks to manage task data.

## Uses

- Component-Based Architecture: Encourages modular code, as each part of the app (task list, task item, form, etc.) can be managed independently,       making the app more maintainable.
- State Management Practice: Helps developers practice managing local state (with useState or useReducer), a key skill in React.
- Reusable Components: Allows developers to create reusable components (e.g., input forms, buttons, task items), which can be used in other projects.
- Expandable Framework: The app can be easily enhanced with additional features like authentication, notifications, and cloud storage integration.
